I'll help create a comprehensive 2D ARPG prototype in Godot 4.x based on the provided blueprint. Let me first check the project structure and create necessary files.
I'll start by creating the essential project structure and core files. First, let's create a PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md to document our organization:
Now let's create the todo.md to track our implementation progress:
Let's create the info.md file with project details and technical specifications:
Now let's create the core directory structure:
I see there was an issue with the PowerShell command. Let's create directories one by one:
Great! Now let's start implementing the core systems. We'll begin with the state machine base class since it will be used by both player and enemy systems:
Now let's create the state machine class:
Now let's create the base character stats resource that will be used by both players and enemies:
Now let's create the player scene and its basic movement script:
Now let's create the player states:
Let's create the move state:
Let's create the attack state:
Now let's create a basic enemy controller:
Let's create the enemy states. First, the idle state:
Now let's create the chase state:
Let's create the enemy attack state:
Let's create a basic item system. First, the item data resource:
Now let's create the inventory system:
Let's create a basic UI system. First, the HUD:
Now let's create the inventory UI:
Let me try that edit again:
Now let's create the inventory slot UI component:
Now let's add the swap_items function to the Inventory class:
Now let's create a basic map generator:
Let's create a debug console to help with development:
Note: we default stop the agent after 25 tool calls since it is an experimental feature. Please ping us at hi@cursor.com if you think we should increase this limit. If you need more tool calls, please give the agent feedback and ask it to continue.

Let's create the necessary scene files for our core components. First, let's create the player scene:
Now let's create the enemy scene:
Now let's create the HUD scene:
Now let's create the inventory UI scene:
Let me try that edit again:
Now let's create the inventory slot scene:
Now let's create the debug console scene:
Let me try that edit again:
Now let's create a basic test map scene:
Now let's update the todo.md to reflect our progress:
Now let's create a project configuration file to set up input actions:
Let's update the todo.md again to mark the input configuration as complete:
Now let's create a default environment resource:
We've now completed the basic setup of our 2D ARPG prototype! Here's what we've created:
Core Systems:
State machine system for handling character states
Character stats system for managing health and attributes
Player controller with movement and combat
Enemy AI with pathfinding and combat
Inventory system with item stacking and drag-and-drop
Procedural dungeon generation
UI Systems:
HUD with health display
Inventory UI with item info
Debug console with useful commands
Project Configuration:
Input mappings for movement, combat, and UI
Physics layers for proper collision handling
Default environment settings
The next steps would be to:
Add placeholder assets (sprites, tiles, etc.)
Create sample items and enemies
Add sound effects and music
Implement additional features like save/load system
Polish the gameplay and UI
Would you like me to continue with any of these next steps?
