START - COLLABORATIVE MULTI-AGENT SIMULATION: ADVANCED PRODUCTION-GRADE ARPG BLUEPRINT GENERATION FOR GODOT 4.2+ (2D)
OVERALL WORKFLOW SIMULATION:
You will simulate a multi-agent development process sequentially. Adopt the perspective and fulfill the specific goals of each agent role outlined below. Each phase builds upon the previous one. The final output should be a single, consolidated, and refined blueprint incorporating insights from all phases.
PHASES & AGENT ROLES:
Phase 1: Architect Agent - Blueprint Generation: Generate the initial draft of the blueprint based on all technical requirements specified below. Focus on completeness, core architecture, and fulfilling the system-specific requirements.
Phase 2: Reviewer Agent - Critical Analysis: Critically review the Architect Agent's draft (output of Phase 1). Identify potential weaknesses, inconsistencies, violations of core principles (modularity, data-driven), unclear sections, missing edge cases, non-adherence to best practices, and scalability concerns. Document these findings explicitly as "Reviewer Notes" within relevant sections or as a separate summary list cross-referenced to the blueprint sections. Do not rewrite the blueprint yet, focus on critique and identifying areas for improvement.
Phase 3: Optimizer Agent - Performance & Scalability Refinement: Analyze the Architect's draft and the Reviewer's notes, focusing specifically on performance, resource management, and long-term scalability. Propose concrete optimizations, alternative algorithms/data structures, identify potential bottlenecks, and suggest changes to enhance performance and handle larger scale (more content, entities, complex interactions). Provide optimized code snippets or revised architectural suggestions where applicable, explicitly labeling them as "Optimization Proposals".
Phase 4: Toolsmith Agent - Tooling Enhancement & Validation: Evaluate the custom tools proposed/generated by the Architect. Assess their usability, robustness, integration feasibility, and effectiveness in addressing development workflows or debugging needs. Suggest improvements, refinements, or entirely new tools that would significantly enhance the development process based on the proposed architecture. Document these as "Tooling Enhancement Notes".
Phase 5: Integrator Agent - Final Consolidation & Polishing: Synthesize the original blueprint draft (Phase 1) with the critiques (Phase 2), optimizations (Phase 3), and tooling enhancements (Phase 4). Resolve conflicts, ensure consistency, improve clarity, and produce the final, polished, comprehensive blueprint document according to the "Deliverable Structure". Explicitly mention where significant changes were made based on previous phases' feedback (e.g., "Refactored PlayerMovement based on Reviewer feedback for clarity and Optimizer feedback for performance.").
AGENT META-INSTRUCTIONS (Apply contextually for each phase):
State Your Role: Begin each phase's output by clearly stating which Agent role you are currently embodying (e.g., "--- PHASE 2: REVIEWER AGENT ANALYSIS ---").
Proactive Problem Solving: (Architect, Optimizer, Toolsmith) Anticipate issues.
Justify Choices: (Architect, Optimizer, Integrator) Explain significant decisions.
Critical Eye: (Reviewer) Be thorough and critical, referencing the prompt's principles.
Focus: (Optimizer) Prioritize performance/scalability. (Toolsmith) Prioritize tool effectiveness.
Clarity & Actionability: (Reviewer, Optimizer, Toolsmith) Ensure feedback is clear and suggests concrete actions or areas needing change.
Synthesis: (Integrator) Combine all inputs logically and produce a coherent final document.
Assume Professional Context: Target experienced developers.
Prioritize Robustness & Scalability: This is the ultimate goal.
Strict Adherence: Follow structure, formatting, placeholders meticulously in the final output.
AGENT CONTEXT:
User OS: Windows
Agent Autonomy: Expected to design/generate custom tools, utilities, plugins (@tool), debuggers, validators, etc., as required by the blueprint and refined during the Toolsmith phase.
Expected Output Format (Final - Phase 5): A single, comprehensive, richly structured technical design document suitable for professional game development, emphasizing scalability and maintainability. Use Markdown.
Target Godot Version: Godot Engine 4.2 or later. Specify version dependencies.
PROJECT OVERVIEW (Input for Architect Agent - Phase 1):
Objective: Design and document a highly scalable, deeply modular, and production-ready blueprint for a 2D Action RPG prototype using Godot Engine 4.2+. Foundation for significant future expansion.
Core Principles: Extreme Modularity, Data-Driven Architecture, Robust Logic (HSMs, Event Bus, Service Locators/DI), Integrated Toolchain, Testability & QA, Performance Awareness, Forward-Compatibility. (These principles are crucial for the Reviewer Agent).
DELIVERABLE STRUCTURE (Target for Integrator Agent - Phase 5):
Executive Summary: Overview of the final architecture, key patterns, tools. Highlight major refinements made during the simulated process.
Core Architecture: Scene Composition, Communication (Event Bus detailed impl.), Data Management & Validation, Project Setup.
System Blueprints: (Detailed sections: Player, Enemy, Map Gen, Loot/Items, UI)
Scene/Node Hierarchies (Diagrams/Text)
GDScript Implementation (Final, commented, typed)
Resource Definitions (.gd, sample .tres)
Godot Editor Workflow
Testing & Debugging Procedures
Consolidated Custom Tools & Utilities (Description, Usage, Integration)
Consolidated Scalability & Future Expansion Notes
(Optional but Recommended: Include summaries of Reviewer/Optimizer/Toolsmith feedback that led to the final design for context)
Global Systems & Managers: (Event Bus, Game State, Asset Loader, Save/Load stubs)
Generated Toolchain Summary: Consolidated list and documentation access points.
Placeholder Reference: Syntax definition and list of critical placeholders.
(The SYSTEM-SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS, ARCHITECTURE & IMPLEMENTATION GUIDELINES, PLACEHOLDER INSTRUCTIONS, ADVANCED/FUTURE-READY EXTENSIONS NOTES, and PRESENTATION/OUTPUT INSTRUCTIONS sections from the previous prompt remain unchanged here. They serve as the primary input for the Architect Agent in Phase 1 and the reference standards for the Reviewer, Optimizer, Toolsmith, and Integrator Agents in subsequent phases.)
FINAL AGENT NOTES (For the AI executing this entire prompt):
Execute each phase sequentially, clearly marking the transition and adopting the specified role.
The outputs of Phases 2, 3, and 4 are primarily analytical notes or specific modification proposals intended to guide the final integration.
The final output (Phase 5) must be a single, cohesive document integrating all previous work and analysis into the requested Deliverable Structure.
This multi-agent simulation aims to produce a more robust, well-vetted, and production-ready blueprint than a single-pass generation might achieve. Leverage the different perspectives to strengthen the final design.
