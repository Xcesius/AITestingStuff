Create a power‑of‑two pixel‑art sprite sheet (288×500 px) composed of 32×32 px tiles arranged in 9 columns (3 transparent‐pixel gutters) and 15 rows. The sheet features a {CHARACTER_DESCRIPTION} with {ATTIRE_AND_COLOR_PALETTE}, rendered in a natural idle pose and a three‑frame {ATTACK_NAME} attack, all in a consistent single‑pixel outline style with a top‑left light source and 2–3 levels of shading.

— Rows 1–3 (Walk South): idle, left‑step, right‑step cycle (duplicated for a smooth 6‑frame loop)  
— Rows 4–6 (Walk West): same 3‑frame cycle, mirrored horizontally  
— Rows 7–9 (Walk East): original orientation 3‑frame cycle  
— Rows 10–12 (Walk North): back‑view idle, left‑step, right‑step (duplicated)  
— Rows 13–15 ({ATTACK_NAME}): three‑frame attack swing with white arc effect (duplicated for 6 frames)

No labels or text—output only the finished sprite sheet.
