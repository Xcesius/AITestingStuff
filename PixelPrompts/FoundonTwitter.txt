[CHARACTER=paladin] [STYLE=pixel‑art] [2DTO3D=no]
  
Create THREE cohesive sprite sheets.  

─ROW 1 – 8‑View Base Model ─
• If 2DTO3D=yes → T‑pose in 8 rotations (front, 45°, side, 135°, back, 225°, other side, 315°).   
• If 2DTO3D=no  → Natural idle pose in the same 8 rotations.   
• Match the chosen STYLE exactly.  

─ ROW 2 – Adaptive Equipment Grid─
• Auto‑invent **8–12 distinct gear/prop items** (no duplicates within or across sheets) that logically suit the CHARACTER; cover head, torso, arms, legs, feet, plus one‑two signature extras.   
• Render each item in its own cell at the clearest modelling angle(s), using the same STYLE.   
• Ensure every piece fits the ROW 1 model without clipping; if 2DTO3D=yes, favor modelling‑friendly perspectives.  

─ Global Constraints ─
• Keep all three sheets visually and stylistically consistent (palette, light direction, line weight).   
• Use power‑of‑two canvases ≤ 2048 × 2048 px; leave padding for atlas packing.   
• Output **only** the finished sprite sheets—no explanatory text.
